# Bob-the-Stickman

Hello, this is my first public repository on Github and also the first game I have ever released. The game is inspired by Henry Stickmin[1], a game that I really enjoy and can highly recommend to anyone with a sense of humor. I wrote the game in Processing[2] and designed it using GIMP[3]. I will also make the game available for download on my website[4], along with some other games that I have partially developed simultaneously, but also before this one.



I hope you like it and look forward to your feedback!
